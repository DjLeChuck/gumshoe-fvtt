# CHANGELOG

## v4.8.0 (2021-12-31)

Happy new year! A big update. 

* **Tested against Foundry VTT v9.238**
* **Rich text support!** All the places where previously we had plain-text notes areas, you can ow choose to edit as either rich text (using Foundry's standard rich text editor,) [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) (if you're into that sort of thing), or plain text.
* Rules support for the **"Moribund World" system**, which is very similar to GUMSHOE but not quite.
* **The "Nuke" button is now hidden** unless you're using the [ðŸ§™ Developer Mode](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/_dev-mode) module.
* Speaking of which, [ðŸ§™ Developer Mode](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/_dev-mode) is now the preferred way to activate developer features.
* You can now set the **Initiative Ability** directly from the character sheet. This a great QoL feature, thanks to @yariv).
* German translations! Thanks to `@muwak` on Gitlab.
* **Bug fix** There were some missing translations around combat ordering. Fixed now.
* **Bug fix** The new chat messages from 4.7.0 could go weird if the relevant ability or weapon was removed. Fixed now.

## v4.7.1 (2021-11-01)

* Whoops
* Update `compatibleCoreVersion` in system manifest (#54)

## v4.7.0 (2021-11-01)

* **Improved chat messages** for spends, tests, and combat rolls (#26).
* **(Initial) Foundry v9.x compatibility** - seems okay but we will monitor as FVTT 9.x progresses (#54).
* Bug fix: there were some check boxes which were a bit laggy (#55).
* The Delta Groovy theme has had some polish (#56, #57).
* Behind-the-scenes code improvements (#53, #58).


## v4.6.0 (2021-10-20)

* **New "Play" and "Edit" tabs** (#41) Thanks to Yariv Yanay (@yariv on Discord, @yarrriv on GitLab). The main character sheet tab is now interative and you can performs tests and spends directly from it instead of having to open the ability pop-up. There's also an "Edit" tab for rapid ability editing.
* **Behind the scenes** Two chnages which won't be visible to the user, but which will affect development: 1. I've semi-automated pulling in translations from Transifex, so it'll be nice and easy to keep up to date with the translation contributions. 2. The way themes are authored has been completely refactored. This will bear fruit later.

## v4.5.0 (2021-10-04)

* **Casting the Runes** (#45) With thanks to The Design Mechanism, we have full support for [Casting the Runes](http://thedesignmechanism.com/Casting-the-Runes.php), the GUMSHOE-system RPG based on the works of M. R. James.
* **Brazilian Portuguese translations** (#46) Big thanks Diogo A Gomes.
* **Bug fix** The party matrix was broken if you had any non-ability compendium packs selected as default PC packs. Terribly sorry for any inconvenience etc., fixed now.

## v4.4.0 (2021-09-28)

* **New actor type and ability pack for NPCs!** (#5) Thanks to Yariv Yanay (@yariv on Discord, @yarrriv on GitLab). This closes one of the oldest feature requests.
* **Two new character sheet themes!** Delta Groovy and Green Triangle (#20)
* **Editable image for abilities and equipment!** (#28) Also the ability to view an image full size.
* **All GUMSHOE SRD v3 abilities in one handy pack!** (#22) Even the ones that aren't in other packs.
* **Babele translations for various packs!** (#40) Big thanks to @Simone [UTC +2]#6710 for patching Babele to allow systems to distribute translations.
* **Bug fix** Package size is down from 4.4MB to 1.4MB (#39)
* **Bug fix** Weapons and equipment can now be dragged out from the character sheet to the sidebar (#44)

## v4.3.0 (2021-09-16)

* **French translations!** Merci @algol.
* A compendium pack of default **SRD weapons** - thanks @yariv/@yarrriv
* **Editable hit threshold** on the character sheet (#24) - this is purely informative at this point but I have ideas about making combat rolls better.
* **Icons for weapons & equipment** (#27). Editable images for these (and abilities) is on the list for later.
* **Notes field on abilities** (#19) This has been asked for by a few people.
* Abilities can be marked as **"Goes first in combat"**, and they will always go before anyone using an ability which is not marked as "goes first in combat". This lets you have a Night's Black Agents-style "guns go first" rule.
* **SRD weapons pack!** Thanks to Yariv Yanay (@yariv on Discord, @yarrriv on GitLab)
* **Bug fix**: Longer translations were pushing the ability configuration dialog (and others) out of whack (#29)
* **Bug fix**: Various translation fixes (#32, #31, #30)

* **Catalan translations!** INVESTIGATOR officially works in Catalan now, thanks to David Montilla (@montver) (#21).
* **Bug fix:** Initiative is now based on the selected "combat ordering" ability (this was a Foundry 0.8.x breaking change) (#15)
* **Bug fix:** Weapons which don't use ammo, no longer show an ammo count (#32).
* **Bug fix:** Newly created abilities now have the right icon and have a category set (another latent Foundry 0.8.x breaker.) (#18 and #23)
