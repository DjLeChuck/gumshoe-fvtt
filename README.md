## How to install

This sytem isn't registered so to install it into your Foundry instance:

1. On the admin screen, got to **Game Systems**
2. Click **Install System**
3. Where it says **Manfest URL**, paste in

    ```
    https://gitlab.com/n3dst4/trail-of-cthulhu-unsanctioned/-/raw/release/src/system.json
    ```
    
4. Click **Install**


## Making PCs

All the character abilities are represented as Items. They should all auto-populate wyhen you create a character, but there are compendium packs containing all the standard abilities from Trail of Cthulhu if you'd like to import them.

## Bug reports and contact

If you have a GitLab account, then by all means log an issue over at [the project site][project-site]. Merge requests are also welcome!

Otherwise you can email me at `neil at lumphammer.com`, or hit me up on Discord (search for `n3dst4#8227`.)


## Development & general hacking

If you're a developer and you'd like to hack on this code, please be aware it uses Webpack and React so some of it will not look like normal Handlebars + JQuery Foundry stuff.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Copy `foundryconfig_template.json` to `foundryconfig.json` and edit it to fill in the `dataPath`, e.g.  `"dataPath" "/home/ndc/foundrydata",`.
3. `npm i` to install dependencies
4. `npm run build` to do a build
5. `npm run link` to link it into your foundry data folder
6. `npm start` to start a live incremental build (so you don't need to keep running `npm run build` after every change).
7. Open your local foundry server and create a world with "Trail of Cthulhu (Unsanctioned)" as the system.

## Generating Compendia

1. In your **Items** tab, delete the "Trail of Cthulhu Abilies" folder
2. In the **Compendium Packs** tab, make sure the edit lock is toggled off for the pack (right click and `Toggle edit lock` if you see a padlock.) 
3. Open the browser console (F12) and type `generateTrailAbilitiesData()`
4. Check the compenium packs if you like
5. Copy the `packs/*.db` files back from `dist/` into `src/`


## Release process

We have "release" branch. Its job is to hold a manifest version that points to the right release download.

To perform a release from `master`: 

1. Update the version in `package.json` and `system.json`.
2. Update the CHANGELOG.
3. Run `npm run package`.
4. Add the downloadable package .zip to the *previous* tag
5. Get the download URL for the asset.
6. Paste it into the `download` field of `system.json`.
7. Commit and push.
8. On GitLab, create a tag matching the new version.
9. FF the `release` branch to to `master`.

Now, anyone who installs or upgrades, will see the new manifest, and the new download.

Why do we have a separate `release` branch? To keep control. The manifest on `master` can be unstable, broken, experimental, whatever and we know that users will be safely looking at the `release` version.
