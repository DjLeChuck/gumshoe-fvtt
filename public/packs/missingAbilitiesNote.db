{"_id":"UEU0IiUhsPl7YBB5","name":"MISSING ABILITIES? READ THIS!","content":"<p>Hello! You may be wondering why the ability compendiums supplied with this system seem to be missing certain abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>The reason</strong>: because this is an unofficial system, we can only ship abilities that appear in the <a href=\"https://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/the-gumshoe-system-reference-document/\">GUMSHOE SRD</a>. The SRD is fantastic document which lists many abilities, but not not all of them. So we've had to leave several out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How to add the missing abilities</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>In the <strong>Items</strong> tab, create a new folder. Give it a name like \"Cthulhu extra abilities\" or whatever.</li>\n<li>Add abilities as follows:\n<ol>\n<li>Click \"<strong>New Item</strong>\" (looks like a quill pen) next to the folder name.</li>\n<li>Pick \"investigativeAbility\" or \"generalAbility\"</li>\n<li>Configure the ability as needed.</li>\n<li>Repeat until you have all the additional abilities you need.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Right-click the folder and <strong>Export to Compendium.</strong></li>\n<li>Flip over to the <strong>Game Settings</strong> tab and click <strong>INVESTIGATOR System Setting.</strong></li>\n<li>Pick a the <strong>System Preset</strong> that you want.</li>\n<li>See where it says <strong>Compendium packs for new PCs</strong>? Put a tick (check) next to the name of your new \"Extra abilities\" compendium.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Done! New PCs will now automatically be given the abilities in your new compendium. Also, if you create a party tracker, it will show those abilities in the list.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How to set up abilities for a completely custom game</h2>\n<p>Exactly the same as above, except when you get to <strong>Compendium packs for new PCs</strong>, you only select your new compendium, and de-select any of the built-in ones.<br /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"RIiGp29oY8FCs9QI":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.qwTAyshXIUK3orqa"}}}
